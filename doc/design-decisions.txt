Be simple, pragmatic, and opinionated. It takes time to please everyone, and
if you want to please everyone eventually no one is happy.

== No registration and no login

Users do not have to register, do not have to login. Why bother register and
login to play a casual game? Just Connect And Play (TM).

For this reason, the user list appears as:
You
Guest1
Guest2
...
GuestN

== No game configuration

The game configuration has been decided by the developers for "normal" users.
The games are multiplayer and the users come to play immediately, why waste
time to configure? If a user is able to configure, it cannot be sure that
the others are also happy. Also, the configuration table can be hard to
understand for newcomers.

== No total timeout

There is one-move timeout, but no total timeout.
